# linux-terminaltool-procedureFinder

How does it work ? 

- First of all, we open the terminal in our operating system and enter the file location.
- Don't forget to update the project file path in the code
- ./Spfinder.php --path=<projectName> --database=<databaseName>
- When you run the above code, it will print the results on the screen by comparing between procedures.
